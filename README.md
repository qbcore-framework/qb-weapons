Weapon Logic Script For QB-Core

# BrianTU Update:
    - QB-Target interaction setup by vector4.
    - Individual table pricing, time and "ownership" timeout. Finders Keepers am I right?
    - Table types i.e. public, private, job, gang.
    - Table timeout is still restricted to the table type. If you don't want to use it, I added an option to put "false" into the field
